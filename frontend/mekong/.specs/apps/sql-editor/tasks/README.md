## 🤖 AI Agent Guidelines

### Task Selection Strategy
1. **Start with P0 tasks** in Phase 1
2. **Complete dependencies first** before starting dependent tasks
3. **Focus on one feature area** at a time for coherence
4. **Test thoroughly** before moving to next task

### Implementation Approach
1. **Read the FRD section** for the feature being implemented
2. **Review existing code** in `src/apps/sql-editor/page.tsx`
3. **Follow TypeScript patterns** and existing architecture
4. **Use shadcn/ui components** consistently
5. **Write tests** for all new functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- All functions have TypeScript types
- Error handling follows established patterns
- Components use proper React patterns
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS classes
- No console.log in production code
- Proper JSDoc comments
- Test coverage above 80%
- Accessibility compliance
